# Automatic Image Downloader from Google (Web-Scrapping)

## Caution
- It is not encouraged to scrap the web for downloading images. This project is done for learning purposes.
- Google is continuously changing their HTML architecture. Therefore, it is unsure that this code works perfectly all the time.
- The last time I have checked it working on September 1, 2020
- This code is essential if any one wants to learn some deep learning / machine learning based projects for image recognition. They can downlaod 70-100 images from GOOGLE by using this code to create their own dataset.


## How to Use this Book
- Run main.py
- In the prompt window provide the desired images you want. Suppose: I want images of cat. Write cat when it asks you 'What are you looking for? '
- Provide the number of images you want when it asks you 'How many images do you want download? '
- After providing all of these information, it will create a directory named as 'cat' into your main directory and keep all the downloaded images into that.
- This code can download 70-100 images by scrapping GOOGLE. All the images are not in full resolutions. Mostly they are based on the thumnail sizes.


# Thank You.
